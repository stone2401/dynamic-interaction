# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Dynamic Interaction system to ensure that browser windows are consistently brought to the foreground during MCP conversations. Currently, the first MCP conversation correctly opens and focuses the browser window, but subsequent conversations only send messages without bringing the browser window to the top layer, reducing user awareness of new interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user interacting with AI agents through MCP, I want the browser window to be brought to the foreground for every new conversation, so that I'm immediately aware when the AI agent needs my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new MCP conversation starts THEN the system SHALL bring the browser window to the foreground
2. WHEN a subsequent MCP conversation begins THEN the system SHALL focus the existing browser window to the top layer
3. WHEN the browser window is already open but not focused THEN the system SHALL make it the active window
4. WHEN multiple browser tabs are open THEN the system SHALL focus the specific tab containing the Dynamic Interaction interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with multiple applications open, I want the browser focus behavior to be consistent across different operating systems, so that the experience is reliable regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on macOS THEN the browser window SHALL be brought to the foreground using appropriate system APIs
2. WHEN running on Windows THEN the browser window SHALL be brought to the foreground using appropriate system APIs
3. WHEN running on Linux THEN the browser window SHALL be brought to the foreground using appropriate system APIs
4. IF the system cannot programmatically focus the window THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators to alert the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the system, I want the window focusing behavior to be configurable, so that I can disable it if it interferes with my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read configuration settings for window focus behavior
2. IF window focusing is disabled in configuration THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to bring the browser to the foreground
3. WHEN configuration is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the new settings without requiring a restart
4. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL default to enabling window focus behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that window focusing doesn't cause system instability or unexpected behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser window is minimized THEN the system SHALL restore and focus the window
2. WHEN the browser process is not responding THEN the system SHALL handle the focus attempt gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN multiple instances of the browser are running THEN the system SHALL focus the correct instance
4. IF window focusing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue normal operation
5. WHEN the user has explicitly moved focus to another application THEN the system SHALL respect user intent and provide non-intrusive notifications
